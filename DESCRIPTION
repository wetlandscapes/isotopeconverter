Description: The intent of this package is pretty simple: Allow users to convert
    between different isotopic standards, while accounting for uncertainties in
    those conversions. For example, if you were provided Hydrogen-2 isotope data
    in units of permil on the VSMOW2 scale, but wanted to know the actual 2H/1H
    ratio, then this package can help automate those conversions, while also
    accounting for uncertainties in VSMOW2.
